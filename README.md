# Elias Vakkuri's portfolio repository

This repository contains code and script samples that I have created along the way, at work and self-studying. I aim to document these to a readable level, however some examples are probably documented better that others.

The repository folders are organized as follows:
- python: Code examples with Python
    - data_manipulation: Examples of data manipulation with Python (e.g. numpy, pandas, matplotlib)
    - deep_learning: Examples of deep learning with Python (pytorch)
    - machine_learning: Other machine learning examples with Python (scikit-learn)
- terraform: Examples of cloud infrastructure-as-code with Terraform
